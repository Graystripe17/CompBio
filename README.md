## Project 1: Protein alignment
Use Needleman-Wunsch and Smith Waterman algorithm to align protein sequences according to blosum matrix.
`python3 align.py`

## Project 2: Implementing decision tree for protein RSA prediction
Using a feature matrix of 20 amino acid residues, use ID3 decision tree to predict protein relative solvent accessibility
`python3 dt.py`

## Project 3: Implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes for protein secondary structure prediction
Given evolutionary profile (pssm), use GNB to predict if protein is part of secondary structure. This was a fun one.

`python3 gnb.py`

## Project 4: Implementing Logistic Regression for Protein Contact Map prediction
Use logistic regression to predict protein residue-residue contacts.

`python3 lr.py`

## Project 5: Protein Structural Similarity Prediction with Linear Regression
Use linear regression with SGD to predict TM-scores based on pssm, eb, and hec.

`python3 p5.py`
